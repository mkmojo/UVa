The note in the problem about number zere and letter O should be interpreted as the following:
    number 0 will not show up in the input, because it is invalid
    only letter O will show up in the input

First mistake:
    Did not notice there should be a newline after each output.

Second mistake:
    When checking palindrome, did not check the letter with itself if the input string is of odd number of characters. 


Good reference is here:

    The way it constructs the map is very very elegant. Worth learning!
